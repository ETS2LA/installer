### üöÄ **Getting Started**


### üêç **For Python 3.10**

1.  **Download the Zip File from [**HERE**](https://github.com/ChrisColeTech/tkinter-standalone/releases/download/1.0.0/tkinter-standalone.zip)**: Unzip the provided archive to reveal the `tkinter` directory.
2.  **Navigate to**: `tkinter/3.10/python_embedded`
3.  **Move Files**: Drag and drop the files from `python_embedded` to your embedded Python directory.
4.  **Verify Structure**:  After moving the files, your folder structure should resemble this:

    **Ensure**:
    
    *   `tcl` folder is at the root of the embedded distribution.
    *   `tkinter` folder is at the root of the embedded distribution.
    *   `_tkinter.pyd`, `tcl86t.dll`, and `tk86t.dll` are in the `DLLs` folder.
    *   **IMPORTANT:** Either replace `python310._pth` with the one provided in the Zip or edit your current `python310._pth` to include `./DLLs`.
5.  **Test Tkinter**: Run the following command to confirm Tkinter is set up correctly:
    
    `python -m tkinter`
